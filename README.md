## BUSINESS PROBLEM:

In today's digital world, users are overwhelmed with vast amounts of content, whether it's movies, products, music, or news articles. Businesses struggle to keep users engaged by providing personalized recommendations. Without an effective recommender system, customers may churn, engagement may decline, and businesses may lose revenue opportunities.


For example, in an online movie streaming platform, users need relevant and personalized movie recommendations based on their viewing history and preferences. A poor recommendation system may result in users struggling to find interesting content, leading to lower customer satisfaction and reduced subscription retention.

1. Collaborative Filtering: Predict user preferences based on similar users.

2. Content-Based Filtering: Recommend items similar to what a user has liked before.

3. Hybrid Approach (Optional): Combine multiple recommendation techniques for better accuracy.

4. Performance Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of different models using evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
